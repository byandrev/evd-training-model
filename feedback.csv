45881,"Rand was a good guy, really... he was. But I felt he had an alter-ego when he left to go home and grade. His expectations and how he picked apart his students papers was simply not fair. Again, great guy but avoid this class with him!!!",awful
45881,"He is brilliant in his field, but expects his students to perform at high levels, with unrealistic expectations. Only by a miracle did I get an A, and that was after a heavy curve. He does care about his students though, as he gives lots of time in class for work, while he goes around giving tips and answering questions.",poor
45881,He has a major in philosophy which is why all the papers you have to write are based on philosophy. As long as your paper agrees with what he thinks you will get a good grade. Otherwise the class is boring and he talks for an hour about nonsense but it is mandatory to attend otherwise your grade will drop.,awful
45881,"I thought his class was extremely hard but despite it all, I became a confident writer. People on here say 'you can only get a c on a paper' WRONG. I got an A and a B. You just have to be in it to win it. If you want to get an A, get a different teacher. If you want learn, Go for Rand. He made Eng. 110 worth something.",good
45881,"I recently just finished taking Comp 110 with Rand and it was the hardest class of my freshman semester. He takes it way too serious for a 100 level class. 80% of the class is papers so you would think you control the grade you get, right? Wrong.  He will tear apart your paper and give you a bad grade despite your efforts. I worked hard for a C.",poor
45881,"Steven Rand is a nice person and really interesting to hear him speak. I am always inspired after a lecture. However, never expect to get anything higher than a C. You can think your paper is perfect but, he will tear it apart in seconds. Take a different professor if you don't want to put 9 hours of work into a paper you get an 'average' grade on.",good
45881,Hard class ,good
45881,He graded a 100 level class like we were all English majors in a 300 or above level class. Never got higher than a C on a paper. I went to the writing center for every paper. Very unclear in instructions and hard to approach with questions. Don't take the class from him.,awful
45881,Tough grader on papers make sure you do your work and drafts. Participation grades save you in the long run. Dont miss class and do your work. Go to the tutor center helps alot,poor
45881,Do not take English 110 with Rand. I don't feel any better at writing due to his confusing grading style. ,poor
45881,Bottom line Rand needs to retire before he ruins everyone's GPA's.  He thinks he knows so much about English and thinks it is his job to make essay assignments unneeded riddles.  He answers questions with questions and likes to talk trash about high school English teachers; hating on the high school teachers ironically makes it like high school. FR,awful
45881,He will only give your paper a C. It does not matter if it is good or not. Work extremely hard if you plan on passing.,good
45881,one of the worst professors at UND. Extremely hard grader and expects to much in a 100 level class. Thinks that everyone's papers should be masterpieces. No matter how long i spent on a paper i couldnt get higher than a C. Only reason i got a B in the class was because i never missed a class. ,awful
45881,"This class is so pointless its ridiculous.  I'm in the class currently (only because its required.) The class has no relevance to anything in life.  Rand is a ****, the class is so boring. He could make the class so much better by writing papers that actually have meaning to  them instead of what some philosopher said.  Textbook reading is hard!!  ",awful
45881,Horrible professor. He does not believe in A's.  Thinks that other teachers grade too easily.  Answers your questions with other questions that do not help you.  Teaches you irrelevant material that you will never use again. Worst professor I have ever had.,awful
45881,"Worst professor ever. He asked me personal questions that were uncomfortable, made me feel stupid when I asked questions, and overall discouraged me. Do not take english 125 from him.",awful
45881,"I attend his Business and Technical Writing course. Rand humiliates people for not understanding assignments when they ask. Very egotistical, rude to those who need help, very difficult work, hard grader -even on those who are following directions. I highly recommend waiting to take this class from anyone else. Not worth losing points on your GPA.",awful
45881,"He was a very hard grader, but he graded on improvement throughout the semester, not on how great of a  greater you were (I mean he obviously graded on how good of a writer you were, but it was more on how much you progressed). I learned a lot from him. I am even taking me next english class with him. Definitely take his course if you can!",awesome
45881,"Professor Steven Rand is very unclear and grades very hard. If you are in his English classes, drop if you want something less than a C. He hates that 'students were graded too easy in high school' so in response to that, he likes to fail his students.",poor
45881,"He is terrible! If you have him drop him IMMEDIATELY! He is mean, and an extremely hard grader!!!!",awful
45881,Awful. Horrible grading.,awful
45881,I wish I could give him a zero,awful
45881,Not good.,poor
45881,"This was a tough class. I expected all college classes to be like this, but since most are not it was somewhat refreshing to have a professor push me this much. If you are willing to put in the work for Mr. Rand you will reep the benefits. If not, then take this class from someone else.",awesome
45881,"He is a unruly professor. He grades on how he feels your ideas are. There is never a right answer, papers can ALWAYS use improvement. I would not recommend him to anyone wanting a grade over a C, even to get that you must put in an excessive amount of time into each paper.",poor
45881,"He is confusing in every aspect: in lecture, in assignments and in critiquing. His assignments are mundane and never change.  I expected to explore writing and become better.  He is an impossible grader, espcially because he grades on how HE feels about your ideas, not on grammer or content.  VERY DISAPPOINTING.",poor
45881,"Worst teacher I have had at UND. Sorry I don't have a PhD in English. His grading style is way too rough for a 125 class. nobody in my class has an A. I have put in 3x more hours for this class than any other but still this class is my worst grade. If possible, avoid this teacher!",poor
45881,worst experience of my life. expects way too much for a 100 level course. take this class if you want to spend 15 hours on a three page paper and still get a C-. ridiculous grading policies.,average
45881,"For as much of a waste as UNIV 101 is, he did an ok job at keeping things interesting.  Avoid UNIV 101 altogether if you can.",good
45881,"His expectations are high for a required 100-level class, especially since most who take it aren't English majors. To his credit, he's smart and gives good feedback. I wouldn't recommend him to a freshman.",good
45881,Steven rand just a joke!! and so incrediablely socially awkward! do not take this class unless you like to fail out of college! He gives you directions for a paper but grades on whatever is on his mind that day his grading makes no sense and no one has ever gotten an A in one of his classes yet.... if you dont believe me he will tell you this.,awful
45881,"I struggled through his class. First- he's a lawyer, so he'll lead you on making you think one thing without actually promising anything.  Second- he'll give you about 20 different instructions on one paper and he'll grade it by how he's feeling. Stupid class, I worked so hard and managed a B but he told me that I had &quot;weak writing.&quot; Avoid him!",awful
45881,"Hey be nice. Yeah, he's hard to understand, and a very harsh grader, but he's a teacher and at least he's doing his job (of course, everyone including me would love easier, more comprehendable classes) just be greatful he's willing to put up with everyone's bull hoping that he helped at least one student improve in literature.",good
45881,"Stevevn Rand was the absolute worst professor i have ever had.  He's without a doubt the hardest teacher you can take for any english classes.  He grades extremely hard, and not at the level of a 100 class. Also Steven Rand is the biggest &quot;Creeper&quot; he makes everyone around him feel extremely uncomfortable.",poor
45881,"This is the hardest 100 level class ever. It doesn't matter if you dedicate your life to this class, you still won't get an A! Take it a another semester or with a different professor. His directions are unclear. He goes against everything the book says, but tells you to use the book.  He's confusing, a hard grader, and a different guy. STAY AWAY!!",poor
45881,"I am currently in this class.  I took this, because I was told it was supposed to be easier than 120.  I regret staying in this class with Rand as my Professor.  He is nice and pretty smart, but his grading is ridiculous.  He is the hardest grader I have ever encountered.DONT take him, if you are taking this class as a general basically. LISTEN.",average
45881,"I took 125 because I heard it was easier than 120 unless you get a certain professor. Well this is that professor. He's a nice guy but expects perfection and is out of touch with reality. The class is boring and hard, and the book is expensive. First paper was 3-4 pages, last will be 15 with each in between getting larger. Would NOT recommend him.",poor
45881,This was by far the best learning experience I have had at UND. He is a hard grader but he helps by marking your papers with serious suggestions. I feel that many mistake his marks for personal attacks when he is only trying to bring the best out in his students. My writing skills have improved a hundred fold. I would recommend him to anyone.,awesome
45881,"I should have read these comments before I took this class. This was by far the worse teacher I have had! He makes you feel dumb and expects way to much for a 100 level class. Worked my butt off to get a B in the course! If you can, please switch to another teacher, you will be thankful you did!! He expects everyone is an English Major!",awful
45881,I suggest never taking him...i read the comments on here but figured it wouldnt be so bad so stayed in...wrong move...trust me..get out of the class ASAP...his instructions were never clear and he made you write the paper then changed his assignment my advice for the writers group is to just write a bunch of crap because you'll rewrite it anyway,awful
45881,No Comments,awful
45881,"horrible teacher, i had to transfer out of state i hated this guy so much",awful
45881,He was a very unfair teacher... i suggest NOT taking him!,awful
45881,IMPOSSILE!  If it is still possible to drop this class... DO IT!!  It is not possible to get above a C.  And to just get a C you have to work your butt off!,awful
45881,"I think he is a great guy to just talk about music, and fun stuff outside of school, but he never answers questions you have, and gives like a couple B's in the class the rest...  you know...",poor
45881,what can i say about rand....those of you who hate him so much should be lucky that you didn't have to endure his class five days a week for six weeks for an hour and a half each day....YOU SHOULD FEEL SOMEWHAT LUCKY!,awful
45881,This man is the devil trapped in human form. It is currently 2:42am the day before this final paper and I want to gouge my eyes out. If I could give some advice to future students I would recommend dropping at the soonest possible moment and save yourself some time before drop day or prepare to spend 8 hours writing papers to get a C-.I despise him,awful
45881,Impossible to a get above a C- on anything!!! He treats you like you are an employee of a Rocket science nasa program or something......Nice guy but a lil out of touch with reality,poor
45881,he sucks...and he wants you to fail at life...stay away.. far away...,awful
45881,"It is impossible to get a good grade.  If you get a B, congradulations, i think you're a first. he is an unfair grader.  I went to the writing center when he worked and had him look at my paper, made all the changes he told me to do and still go a C.  I spent way too much time on his papers.  If you have him, get out now!!!!!!",awful
45881,Never understood what was asking for because he never told you what he really wanted you to do. He's a total ****.,poor
45881,impossible to get a good grade,poor
45881,"hes pretty tough, expects too much",good
45881,"He expects a lot from his students, but does take the time to get to know everyone.  I'd suggest going to the writing lab before you ask him for help..and he tends to suggest that too, or else be prepared for a lot of red ink.",average
45881,this guy is hard as nails.  all he did was whup my ass when I asked for help,awful
45881,He sucks,awful
45881,He Hated me .... never taught us how to write,awful
45881,Rediculous teacher...kills you on stupid details,poor
601915,"The course is difficult, but doable. Mr. Farm will help you, but the key to this course is to use  math learning center. He is a professor that wants to see you pass so he tries to help as much as possible.",good
601915,"Everyday there is a WebAssign assignment given out (very time consuming and they don't help you on the exams). The three exams he gives are extremely HARD!, all I can say is just practice ... a lot. I got a F on my first exam and had to ace the rest to get an A overall. lastly, the final will wreck you, the girl sitting next to me cried during it.",poor
601915,"Mr. Farm is one of the nicest people you will meet. WebAssign assignments get handed out every day after class to practice problems and a quiz usually appears every day at class. Do a lot of practice questions for the 3 midterm tests. For the final he makes you understand the concepts instead of memorizing problems. Put the work in, get an A.",good
601915,"Tests are hard because they never matched up with notes and lectures. On the final test, we had to get a 70% on it or we didn't pass the Everything that you think is gonna be on the test, is not. Expect homework 4 days a week. Would not recommend.",awful
601915,"Mr. Farm is the best math teacher I have ever had. He is super funny and very passionate about what he does. There is a quiz almost every day in class, but it is not the end of the world if you miss one.",awesome
601915,Take this class with a different prof,awful
601915,He will answer all the questions you have. And he is willing to give his students a second chance to take passed due hw. Random in class quizzes is easy!,good
601915,Stuart is among the nicest professors I've ever had. Unfortunately this didn't translate into him being an effective one. Prepare for loads of homework and daily quizzes.,poor
601915,"If you take a class with Stuart Farm, be ready to spend A LOT of time outside of class on homework, often times teaching yourself unfortunately. Also, there is a quiz in class pretty much every day, so go! The homework is challenging and time consuming, but the tests are much easier which is nice. He isn't the best at explaining material, but ok.",average
601915,Terrible teacher all around. Had him my first year in college for math and got stuck with him again my junior year and nothing changed.. he maybe even got worse..,poor
601915,Nice person but absolutely sucks at teaching math. This class is supposed to be for students who are below the average math scores but he makes it so difficult. I'm bad at math to start with and he doesn't help. Avoid him at all costs.,awful
601915,"I took Math 92 and 93 in one semester, it was very fast paced. If you missed any class you would be behind for a while. All in all he was a good teacher, I think a lot of people didn't like moving at that pace and in turn disliked him.",average
601915,"Took this class for interest, also was the first math course in College. It was very hard to start with, extensive and new HW every class(Webassign), Prepare to do them, with solid understanding. attendence are vital. Test are very based on in class assignments and lecture examples.",good
601915,"Farm has homework almost nightly, but it nothing that wasn't able to be done quickly for the most part.  His final test accounted for the most percentage of the points in the class so studying is mandatory if you want to pass this class.",good
601915,"If you don't show your work or show that you double checked your answers he'll give you a zero, even if you got the question right.  Also you can't skip because he does in class practice that you turn in at the end of the class.",awful
601915,Very Nice guy. very willing to help,average
601915,"Mr. Farm is the nicest man you will ever meet. His concepts are easy to figure out. As long as you pay attention and show up, you will be fine.",good
601915,Kinda quirky but he's a good guy that cares. Show up everyday for free points. Quizzes almost every week (turned into group quizzes by the end of the semester). Test very similar to quizzes. Homework almost every day and it is much harder than what you will see on the quizzes/test though if you ask for extensions you'll get it every time. Math On!,awesome
601915,"Kind of weird, makes corny jokes all the time but one of the better math professors I've had. He's passionate about the subject and it shows. He spends extra time making sure that his students understand the reasons behind why you do certain steps and, for me, it was helpful in my understanding. Recommended.",good
601915,"This class is  a giant headache. So far, we've had over 30 assignments(only worth 20% of grade) that each take hours to complete, because Stuart puts many problems that we never went over in class . On top of that, we have weekly comprehensive quizzes that are inconsistent in difficulty and points. Simply, I pity anyone who has to take this class.",poor
601915,I would not recommend this professor if you' re not strong in math. You should expect to do homework almost every night. New homework assignment after each class. Doesn't give traditional exams but weekly quizzes for points. Text book assigned was of little help. Homework take hours to complete for only small portion of grade.,average
601915,"Stuart Farm, so far, has been the worst professor I have had. He grades so harshly that it is almost impossible to get even a C. (At one point I had a 48%) (& Im the average A/B student) He gives weekly quizzes and gives time consuming homework. I would not recommend him.",poor
601915,"He is the worst teacher that I have had for the past ten years. He goes way overboard with trying to explain things, and when he does explain things, it doesn't show up on the test or quizzes. There are many other students in my class that have no idea what is going on. Don't take any of his classes. You have to teach yourself the lessons.",poor
601915,Stuart Farm is a fantastic guy that is very easy to get along with. Greets you with a smile every day and is excited to see you each and every day and tries to make the class fun. Defenitly introduce yourself to him. He is confusing in his explaining of concepts. He tends to over-explain where it gets confusing. He is a very respectable person.,average
601915,"Stuart Farm is a nice guy and cares about his students, but that doesn't result in effective teaching or keeping the class engaged. He doesn't seem to understand that students taking Math146 are the least likely to raise there hand and contribute, and you can't have a discussion with 100 people. For grades, watch him like a hawk and email him ASAP.",poor
601915,"Mr. Farm is a good teacher, but is not quite clear on the types of questions we need to go over. The homework and in-class assignments are a lot tougher than the actual exams.",good
64144,"He's really disoriented, but a really cool guy and funny. A little hard to understand, but if you read the book, and go to recitation, its not that bad.",average
64144,"Prof Graves is a very interesting man...if you enjoy hearing the sames stories about beer and 50 cent over and over again, I would recommend taking this class! Overall, his class is manageable",average
64144,"The notes barely relate to the tests, as the tests are extremely hard. Most of the answers are E, or when he says &quot;a or c&quot; that is usually the answer. He is a nice guy and he is smart, but he is just a very bad teacher. There are only 2 tests and a final, so your grade can be very low or very high",average
64144,"he's sort of a funny/crazy guy, which makes lectures somewhat more tolerable, yet hard to follow and the class notes don't make much sense, but if you're good at learning on your own from the book you'll probably do well (the amount of material isn't overwhelming or too hard to grasp). as well as he has a very fair grading policy.",average
64144,"I feel that Phil Graves gets a bad rap.  He is far too intelligent to be teaching basic Economics classes to immature college students.  He has a hard time creating enthusiasm for the subject unless you are already interested in it and the people who speak badly of him are there to try and get by with an easy grade.  However, if you pay attention to the lectures or just the notes, an A is easy to obtain.  I missed a lot of class and got an A for two different classes of his.  He is on the cutting edge.",awesome
64144,Very good professor. Helpful and understandable. Well organized notes. One of the only professors ive had the truely wants to see every student succeed. very refreshing in contrast to most professors and TA's who feel that being an ass is what they are there for.,awesome
64144,Graves is awesome to listen to and as a professor he makes the tests short and simple.  He also forms your grade to give you the best possible final grade.,awesome
64144,I took micro economics. He doesn't care about attendance or book reading. Almost everything depends on the exam. If you know the material it's not a super hard exam. But you do need to learn everything he's talking about. His exams covers it all.,awesome
64144,"Study the old midterms, and look through the book. AND don't fall into the trap of thinking he's trying to trick you with his questions - pick the most obvious answer (usually E). The questions are all really similar, every semester.",average
64144,"Pretty interesting professor, funny at times. Uses a lot of interesting real world examples. Exams are harder than you'd expect but reading the textbook he wrote is very helpful",awesome
64144,"probably one of the funniest profs. loves his opinions, some are offensive, but i find that funny. if you go in for help with the paper he gets real excited, he loves talking about who knows what. missed lots of classes. took little notes. study old midterms. he basically tells you what questions will be asked but changes the words to trip you up.",good
64144,Awesome Professor. Really funny.,awesome
64144,Microeconomics- The man absolutely knows his stuff. It is a tough class but he uses interesting examples and introduces concepts relevant to everyone. Class is difficult if econ isn't your thing. Can't wait to take environmental econ with him!,awesome
64144,Graves is very helpful and knows tons about the material. If you have a real interest in econ take his class,awesome
64144,"Graves is an awesome person. I've gone into many of his office hours and had a few one on one meetings with him and I couldn't say a bad thing about him as a person. On the other hand his class is way too long, lectures are boring and hard to stay focused in. Homework and quizzes are not terribly hard, but the tests are impossible!!!!",average
64144,"Although his lectures are way too big, he makes a point to make sure he explains things in a way that most students can understand. His office hours are helpful. On exams, as long as you have done the homework and taken notes, you should do fine. He words his questions a little confusing but they are fairly easy.",average
64144,"Extremely nice and funny guy, however his lectures are boring and throughout the semester many people stop showing up as lectures are not mandatory. Online assignments are challenging, but as long as you read the book and show up to recitations the class is fairly easy",average
64144,"Lectures are very long and easy to become bored, but not mandatory. As long as you read through the book, his power points online, and study with his practice tests, you should do fine. Funny guy, very chill.",good
64144,"Phil is a pretty cool guy, but you really need the book to do well. I pretty much relied on it all semester because his lectures can be long and boring and my TA barely spoke english. I read the book, did the assignments and studied and was still able to pass with an A",average
64144,"Phil is a legend. His lectures are all on point and he keeps you engaged the whole class. He is often behind and gets distracted easily, but he is hilarious. Also its an entry level econ class, you could have a monkey teach it and learn the same thing from a professor that has been teaching their entire career. Phil Graves is a definite must take.",good
64144,"I'm about to finish up microecon with Graves and so far it's been fairly easy. I went to a total of four lectures (2 of which were the midterms) and I have an A in the course. As long as you read the book and go to recitation, you will be fine. Tests can be tricky for a lot of people but he curves the hell out of them.",good
64144,I may be biased because this material comes to me fairly easy but I thought he did a great job teaching the course. My advice would be to not miss class. Lots of anecdotes that I thought kept the class from becoming monotonous. Think I'll try and minor in Econ because of the course.,awesome
64144,Most people are probably gonna rate him poorly but I think his class was great. At the very least he is entertaining. His lectures weren't great but you will learn if you can pay attention unlike 95% of the class.,good
142825,"People complain about the tests, but if your one of those people that likes to know exactly what is on the test and you just have to memorize it then the tests are not bad. It is an entertaining class as well too.",good
142825,"The class was really fun and interesting, but the tests were ridiculous with tons of memorizing. I took the class just as an elective, but it did end up bringing down my GPA. It really depends on how much effort you're willing to put into it",good
142825,She is awesome and really entertaining.,awesome
142825,"The class is pretty intresting and presented in power point which makes note taking easy. Tests on the other hand suck. They're so looooonnnngggg. But at least the essays are written in a different, shorter form.",good
142825,"Patti was one of the best professors I had in college.  She is hilarious... sometimes you laugh with her, sometimes you laugh at her.  Her class keeps you on your feet.  One day we spent the entire hour talking about deviant sexual fetishes.  and you've gotta love the teaching assistants dressing up like prostitutes.  Patti rocks!",awesome
142825,"intresting teacher, you can tell she has been on drugs in the past, thank god this class has a recitation or we would all be in serious grade trouble, liked her class but i don't think i wana have her as a teacher again.",awesome
142825,"Adler as a professor is fun, compassionate, intelligent, and knows the material. She's an amazing sociologist. Relies too much on the TA's and recitations at times. Took this class years ago and the tests were pure memorization of definitions. Easy only if you can memorize things. I still quote concepts learned in class in daily life.",awesome
142825,"halirious! out of her mind, but so fun.  she can go over the material a little fast at times, but is the most accessible prof i've had in a huge lecture such as this.  i think shes good - i wanna be friends with her!",awesome
142825,"Great class. The best class i've taken at CU thus far. However, tests are hard, but it's worth it. Great professor. She has a lot of experience in the stuff she teaches. Hilarious stories.",awesome
142825,"this class is one of the most interesting classes i've ever taken...great professor, a little crazy but she keeps you interested. Only downside-tests are a little hard and lots of memorizing...TAKE THIS CLASS!",awesome
